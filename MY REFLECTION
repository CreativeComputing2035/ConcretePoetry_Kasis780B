Hi Areil,
This is your student Ta here to talk a littl bit about my experience.

So I looked up the word "concrete poetry" online and found that it refers to a poem where a big part of its meaning depends on the visual presentation of the piece.
Now, mind you, I am a big cheese ball for inspiration quote and message so I wanted my first website to be somewhere along that line.
In a nutshell I hope my work succeeded in sending this message: stop running away from your problem (by clicking the word "run") and just accept that it already happened (by clicking the word ran), and move on. 
I did a lot of outside research for this piece, like learning how to use &nbps; for space, as I need to individually place each word to form a swirl or how I need to google a code that would allow 
my webpage to move horizontally. I also managed to pick up some understanding on <style> like controlling the margin and thickness of my text. 
In terms of difficultly, it would definitly be getting starting and the initial research. It took alot of reading on w3school before I could executed by piece. Though I really wish my swirl is bigger and convey more depth,
it was the best I could have done in the moment. Overall, I had a lot of fun coding, it is very satisfying to see your work come to life. I hope you like it!

With respect,
Ta
